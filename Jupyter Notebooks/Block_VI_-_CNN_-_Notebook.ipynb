(Remember, the width of a convolutional layer refers to its number of feature maps.) And the weights for each feature map are shared across all the inputs that feed into the layer. Because of these differences, batch normalizing convolutional layers requires batch/population mean and variance per feature map rather than per node in the layer.\n","\n","> To apply batch normalization on the outputs of convolutional layers, we use [BatchNorm2d](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#batchnorm2d). To use it, we simply state the **number of input feature maps**.

It's a bit more work to implement, but basically involves calculating the means and variances per time step instead of per layer. You can find an example where someone implemented recurrent batch normalization in PyTorch, in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/jihunchoi/recurrent-batch-normalization-pytorch)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kBP2dkeQsSep"},"source":["> **Exercise:** Using CIFAR 10 database, incorporate BN to your solution of Chapter I.
