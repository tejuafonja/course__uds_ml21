For the programming exercises, we will be distributing Jupyter Notebooks.

Besides JupyterLab, which is used to work in the Jupyter Notebooks, you will also
need to have a number of Python packages installed, which are listed in this file. 


The easiest and recommended way is to install anaconda3. It comes pre-packaged with
many scientific python packages, which are a superset of the ones we need, so you
will be all ready to go if you install anaconda3.


If you prefer your own method of installing python packages,
here is a list of Python packages you need:
  - jupyterlab
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - ipython

Optional:
  - ipympl -> this allows you to display zoomable plots in the notebook.


This list is exhaustive for now, but it might be extended for the later notebooks.
